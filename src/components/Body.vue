        As a developer, I love working across the whole stack and taking
        projects all the way from conception to completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve always been curious about the way things work, and enjoy fixing
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in writing simple, elegant, maintainable and reusable code,
        which can be deployed early, often, and with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m proud of what I build, although I recognise that there are always
        improvements to be made, and things to learn, both as a developer and a
        person.
